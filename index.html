  Module Project Overview

    You will build a website to display the bio of your favorite programmer, artist, etc.

    In order to do this, you will create an `index.html` file and scaffold the document
    with the elements shared by all HTML documents:

    - doctype declaration
    - html element
    - head, containing a title and an optional style tag
    - body, containing the markup that renders to the screen

  Requirements

    Review this article: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp

    Create an `index.html` file for your site, or use this same file.

    For your site, you will make use of at least the following semantic elements:

    - header (to contain the main heading of the site, and the nav)
    - nav (to contain some links to navigate to the different sections of this document)
    - section (each holding at least a heading and a paragraph)
    - aside (containing an img and a caption)
    - footer (containing a contact form)
    - form (containing at least two inputs with their labels)

    See an example of a finished site: https://bloominstituteoftechnology.github.io/img/anita-borg-bio-website.png

    The example above is quite simple, but you can make your site as fancy as you'd like. -->

    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <h3>Getting into Apex Lengends 2019</h3>
    <p>
      Before becoming involved with Apex Legends, ImperialHal competed in H1Z1 as a Cloud9 player. His career was cut short by the
       discontinuation of the H1Z1 Pro League, which shut down after just one split. Afterwards, ImperialHal attempted to compete in
        Fortnite, but it was not a game that he enjoyed. When Apex Legends released a few months later, he shifted his focus to the 
        new battle royale. He was signed by TSM alongside former H1Z1 competitors Taylor "THump" Humphries and Jose "ProdigyAces"
         Soto on March 6th, 2019. This roster didn't remain for long, with THump and ProdigyAces being moved off of the starting 
         roster for Mac "Albralelie" Beckwith and Jordan "Reps" Wolfe in the following months.
    </p>
    <p>
      Together with his newly built roster, the first real test for ImperialHal would be at X Games â€” the first proper competition
       featuring professional teams in a private lobby. Heading into the last game tied with Team Reciprocity on a 109 points, TSM 
       scored a crucial top two placement alongside seven kills to secure themselves the X Games gold medal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next up was the Preseason Invitational, the kickoff major for Apex Legends that featured 80 teams from across the globe. TSM 
      entered the tournament as one of the favourites, and advanced through the upper bracket to the grand finals. The grand finals
       featured the newly made format of Match Point. Despite a rough start to the series, TSM still found themselves on Match Point
        after the sixth game. The series went on for another 5 games, and in game 11, TSM secured the win by third-partying the 
        fight between GamersOrigin and MVP at the end. With this win, ImperialHal and TSM were crowned the champions, and became 
        back-to-back LAN winners.

    <h2>Career</h2>
    <h3>The Online Era 2020-2021</h3>
    <p>With the newly introduced Apex Legends Global Series, TSM continued their domination at the North American Qualifier. 
      Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the upcoming Major in Texas was cancelled, and the Global Series moved to an online circuit. 
      TSM won their first online event and continued to place well in subsequent tournaments. However, the team notably failed to 
      pick up any big victories. As a result, TSM replaced Albralelie with Halo veteran Eric "Snip3down" Wrona. Together with 
      the reformed team, ImperialHal continued their run at the top of the ALGS. They eventually placed third in the 2021 Online 
      Championship.</p>

      <p>It was in this era that a rivalry developed between ImperialHal and Christopher "sweetdreams" Sexton. Sweetdreams, who was 
        a fellow H1Z1 competitor, was seen as almost an opposite of ImperialHal due to the way the two players captained their teams.
         The two often battled it out for the top placements in online tournaments.</p>

        <p>Near the end of 2021, ImperialHal had to find a new third player, as Snip3down left to compete in Halo Infinite. 
          Snip3down was replaced by Evan "Verhulst" Verhulst, an up-and-coming player who was making a splash with Esports Arena.
           This move proved to be successful, as they turned their first split in the ALGS Pro League around, even winning the 2022 
           Split 1 North American Playoffs.</p>

    <h3>Return to LANS and switching to controller</h3>
    <p>In the latter half of the 2022 season, TSM finished 7th during the second Pro League split. This secured the team a spot in 
      the 2022 Split 2 Playoffs, the first LAN event since the pandemic. TSM advanced through the group and bracket stages, but 
      ultimately finished in 6th place in the grand finals. The following 2022 Championship saw a tougher run for the team, as they 
      were upset in the winners bracket. They barely advanced to the finals with a 9th place result in the second round of losers, 
      and were merely 4 points above elimination. TSM faltered in the Finals, failing to attain Match Point eligibility despite the 
      series going to 9 games. However, their last game did shoot them up in the rankings, and they finished the competitive year in
       7th place.</p>
       <p>During the off-season, ImperialHal decided to change his input device. Despite being a mouse & keyboard user for the 
        majority of his careeer, he agreed with the growing consensus that controller was superior due to the game's aim assist.
         Although the switch seemed like a risky move, it also appeared to pay off. TSM came into the new competitive year with a 
         strong regular season in the first Split of Pro League, becoming the first seed for the North American region at the Split 1 
         Playoffs. They dominated in the group stages and made their way to the finals through winners. This time, TSM was able to 
         acquire Match Point eligibity after the 5th game. In the 8th game of the series, they found themselves in a straight three 
         versus three against Acend who were also on Match Point. ImperialHal found the first pick in the fight as he ascended with 
         Horizon, allowing TSM to clean up and secure their third LAN victory.</p>

         <p>The second Split of the year would be a tougher one as TSM struggled early on in the season, but with a much needed 
          victory in the second half, they secured another appearance in the Playoffs in London. TSM looked to repeat their previous
           success, once again qualifying for the finals with dominant group stage and bracket performances. The grand finals started
            off well for TSM, but right on their tails were DarkZero Esports, who together with TSM became Match Point eligible after 
            the third game. DarkZero proved to be specialists of the match point format, securing victory in seventh game. TSM 
            finished behind them in second place.</p>

            <p>DarkZero's victory ignited a new rivalry for ImperialHal, as now the Australian Rhys "Zer0" Perry had tied up the 
              score, securing 3 LAN victories himself. This narrative set the stage for the 2023 Championship, which was the next 
              opportunity for the competitors to seize the lead.</p>

              <q>Honestly the passion was ignited after last LAN. I was kind of happy with second place, like I've been at the top 
                for a while, and I feel like someone else is creeping up, like Zer0 and his team. After this last LAN I was like, I
                 have to work even harder, I don't want them to pass me in terms of achievements. The passion is probably even 
                 stronger than the prior two LANs. It's kind of like a rivalry now in a way. It used to be me and sweetdreams, now 
                 it's just me and Zer0."
                Phillip "ImperialHal" Dosen</q>

                <p>Both TSM and DarkZero came into the Championship in top form. In the winners bracket, TSM and DarkZero found 
                  themselves on the brink of an upset. TSM managed to recover, finding a win in the very last game to advance to the 
                  finals. However, DarkZero was relegated to the losers bracket where they were ultimately eliminated, resulting in 
                  an anticlimactic end for the rivalry that was built during the year between ImperialHal and Zer0.</p>

                  <p>Five games into grand finals, TSM was performing poorly with only 22 points, putting them dead last and far 
                    from Match Point. The team rebounded with three back-to-back victories â€” something almost unheard of in a battle
                     royale â€” and won the tournament. ImperialHal was named the MVP of the event, cementing his place as one of the 
                     best players. In September, the Esports Awards nominated him for Esports Controller Player of the Year, an 
                     impressive feat considering he had only switched that year. In November, ImperialHal was also nominated for
                      Best Esports Athlete by the Game Awards.</p>
